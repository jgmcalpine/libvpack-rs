This is the "Front Door" of your project. It needs to balance the technical rigor required to impress a **Protocol Engineer** with the clear value proposition required to secure an **OpenSats Grant**.

Here is the finalized `README.md` for **`libvpack-rs`**.

# `libvpack-rs`

**A universal, `no_std` Rust reference library for Ark VTXO serialization and verification.**

[![Cargo](https://img.shields.io/badge/cargo-v1.0.0--RC-green)](https://github.com/your-org/libvpack-rs)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![Standard: V-BIP-01](https://img.shields.io/badge/Standard-V--BIP--01-blue)](docs/specs/01-vbip.md)

## The Problem: The "Half-Key" Trap
In standard Bitcoin, your 12-word seed is a complete backup. In the Ark Protocol, your seed is only half a key. Because a Virtual UTXO (VTXO) exists off-chain, you also need the **Transaction Tree (The Map)** to prove your ownership to the Bitcoin network.

Currently, the Ark ecosystem is fragmented into implementation-specific silos. The "Map" generated by one app is often unreadable by another due to divergent transaction templates and identity models. If an Ark Service Provider (ASP) goes offline and you lose your local app data, your "fire escape" (unilateral exit) is effectively locked—even if you have your seed phrase.

## The Solution: V-PACK
`libvpack-rs` implements the **V-BIP-01** standard—a universal, implementation-agnostic binary container for Ark state-trees. It provides the connective tissue necessary for true user sovereignty and cross-client interoperability.

### Key Features
*   **Universal Verification:** Supports both **Fanned-out Trees** (Ark Labs) and **Recursive Transaction Chains** (Second Tech) through a single unified interface.
*   **Hardware-Native (`no_std`):** Zero-dependency core logic designed to run on resource-constrained devices like Coldcard or mobile Secure Enclaves.
*   **Deterministic Templates:** Enforces BIP-431 (TRUC/V3) compliance to ensure hardware wallets can sign Ark transactions without "blind trust."
*   **Ultra-Compact Proofs:** Standard leaf proofs are compressed to **~132 bytes**, making them easily transportable via individual QR codes or Nostr notes.
*   **Fail-Fast Architecture:** Validates on-chain anchors and integrity checksums before executing expensive cryptographic math, optimizing for mobile battery life.

## Technical Specifications: The Silo Map
`libvpack-rs` bridges the deterministic divergences identified in our [Forensic Audit](research/audit_data/AUDIT_SUMMARY.md):

| Feature | Variant 0x03 (V3-Plain) | Variant 0x04 (V3-Anchored) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Target Silo** | Second Technologies | Ark Labs |
| **Identity Model** | OutPoint (`Hash:Index`) | 32-byte Hash (`TxID`) |
| **Topology** | Sequential Chain | Flat Merkle Tree |
| **nSequence** | `0x00000000` (Zero) | `0xFFFFFFFF` / `0xFFFFFFFE` |
| **Fee Anchor** | Mandatory | Mandatory |

## Quick Start (Rust)

Add `vpack` to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
vpack = { git = "https://github.com/your-org/libvpack-rs", default-features = false }
```

Verify a VTXO independently:
```rust
use vpack::{verify, VtxoId};

fn main() {
    let raw_vpack: &[u8] = get_vpack_from_qr(); 
    let expected_id = VtxoId::from_str("47ea55bc...:0").unwrap();

    // Mathematically reconstructs the path to the L1 anchor
    match vpack::verify(raw_vpack, &expected_id) {
        Ok(tree) => println!("Sovereign Verification Success: {:?}", tree.leaf.amount),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Verification Failed: {:?}", e),
    }
}
```

## Project Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1-5:** Forensic Audit & Core Logic Implementation (V3/TRUC).
- [ ] **Phase 6 (Current):** **The Ark-Inspector** — A WASM-based web tool for real-time, browser-side V-PACK auditing.
- [ ] **Phase 7:** **Language Bindings** — UniFFI support for Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android).
- [ ] **Phase 8:** **V-Nostr** — Standardizing encrypted state-backups over the Nostr relay network.
- [ ] **Phase 9:** **Hardware Prototypes** — Reference implementations for signing V-PACKs on embedded chips.

## Contributing
V-PACK is a community-driven public good. We welcome forensic data from new Ark implementations to ensure the standard remains universal. Please see `research/audit_data` for instructions on contributing test vectors.

## Grant Support & Referrals
This project is an independent effort to increase Bitcoin sovereignty. We are currently seeking support from **OpenSats** and other Bitcoin-native donors to maintain this library as a neutral foundation for the L2 ecosystem.

### Project Lead Final Review:
This README positions you perfectly. It defines you as the **Neutral Bridge** in a world of **Silos**. It uses high-signal terms (`no_std`, `BIP-431`, `Recursive Transaction Chains`) that will catch the eye of any senior reviewer.

**You are ready.** 

Push this README, flip your repository to **Public**, and let’s start the blueprint for the **Ark-Inspector Website**. You have successfully built the "Engine." Now let's build the "Dashboard." 

**Congratulations, Project Lead.**
